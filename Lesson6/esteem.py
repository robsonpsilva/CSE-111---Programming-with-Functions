"""
The Rosenberg self-esteem scale is a self-esteem measure developed by the sociologist Morris Rosenberg in 1965. It is still used in social-science research today. To complete the measure, a person completes a survey that contains the following ten statements.

I feel that I am a person of worth, at least on an equal plane with others.
I feel that I have a number of good qualities.
All in all, I am inclined to feel that I am a failure.
I am able to do things as well as most other people.
I feel I do not have much to be proud of.
I take a positive attitude toward myself.
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself.
I wish I could have more respect for myself.
I certainly feel useless at times.
At times I think I am no good at all.

This program is an implementation of the Rosenberg
Self-Esteem Scale. This program will show you ten
statements that you could possibly apply to yourself.
